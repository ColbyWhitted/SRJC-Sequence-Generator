--------------General:

deleteItem function is very fragile..

Prevent term and course columns from moving after they are generated

need to update termToRemove array will solve bug I think.

Preventing user from changing terms when there are terms in the modification zone is getting hairy...

To remove array items from the termToRemove array. okay. using Array.remove()

Prevent user from creating recommended course sequence if there are no non-elective courses in program

Should we have semester unit total if it's just always going to be the same?

---------------BUGS:

It's possible to line up term items non-linearly

------------Improvements:

Use different names for terms maybe

----------Future Features:

------

Need to validate this line before doing stuff to it // creatorObject.response.schedules.length != false 


JOSH

Clear elements and variables properly
Indicate Requirements

ADRIENNE

Pluralize Terms
Take Further Electives and GE courses to equal X
Allow users to see other schedules // working on it
PDF in Excel Style Format // will just make table

Need to clear Variable that checks avialble units to be schedule in comparison to units that need to be scheduled;
I think it's called totalPossibleUnits;

Calculation for how many units per semester a student should take for a certificate:'


	Min Units to Meet Program Reqs               = M 
	Units scheduled for this term                   = U 
	Max Units for this term                           = X
	Total Units Scheduled                            = T
	Num Terms Scheduled                            = R
	How many GE and elevtives total to take   = (M - T)
Avg number of electives to take per term       = ((M - T) / R)
  Available Units in term                              = (X - U)
  Solution = solution
	
	if (  ((M - T) / R)  <=  (X - U) ){
		solution =  ((M - T) / R)
	}
	else{
	 solution = (X - U)
	}

	
	Calculation for how many units per semester a student should take for a Major:
	
		if (  ((M - T) / R)  <=  (X - U) ){
		solution =  ((M - T) / R)
	}
	else{
	 solution = (X - U)
