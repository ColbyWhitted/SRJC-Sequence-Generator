# SRJC-Sequence-Generator
This is a recommended course sequence generator that was created for the Santa Rosa Junior College

All Colleges in California per the State Chancellor's office are required to have a recommended course sequence for every program. For colleges with many courses this becomes an extremely cumbersome task because many programs are updated every year! This program posted here is the client side of an application that automates this process. This application allows the user to set options for the recommended course sequence and send it to the server to compute the recommended course sequence. The rcsg-wapi-api.js file is an API for client to server communication that was created by the same party (will be named upon permission) that wrote the genetic algorithm that actually creates the schedule.
